# XY Joints compatible with Fysetc Stealthchanger Shuttle belt spacing

This mod moves X beam 2mm back, allowing to clamp the belts
from the front of the shuttle.

Made for 9mm belts, both AWD and 2WD, and after testing both, there's no gains with AWD due to stealthchanger limitations. You can expect about 4000mm/s^2 accelerations on a 350mm build

I recommend mounting the joints upside down (heatsets on the top) for better clearance when docking

You will loose 2mm of Y travel at the front, so make sure to adjust your dock positions accordingly
