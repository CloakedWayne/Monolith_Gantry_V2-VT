Mod was produced by KhaymKhaym and BootyCallJones 
Based off the Monolith Gantry by CloakedWayned

Assembly Instructions are inside of the CAD file. (reference it ya turd)

DXF for the panel is good to go, use 3mm thick A36 CRS from Send Cut Send or other vendor. 

DXF for the steel reinforcements on the gantry does need to have K factor edit to ensure the bend is proper depending on the material you choose. With 304 Stainless steel the K factor is .66
