# Monolith Gantry R1 Release Candidate 2
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **There is no step-by-step build guide or detailed documentation yet.**

> **The sheet metal version is more difficult to build than what the average Voron user is used to. Please evaluate the required patience and skill levels before proceeding.**

## What's this?
This is a performance-oriented, configurable gantry platform for Voron 2.4 and Trident.

### Drive configurations:
- 2WD
- AWD

### Belt widths:
- 6mm
- 9mm

 ### Materials:
- Printed
- Sheet metal

## What's new with Monolith R1?
- Updated styling
- More shared parts between 6 and 9mm
- Sheet metal options
- Can fit into a stock 2020 frame at the cost of some Y-overtravel with the added no-protrusion mode
- Much better tensioner travel
- No toothed idlers

## 2025 Roadmap
- Milled 9mm AWD kits
- Monolith CPAP SLM toolhead
- Better documentation

## Design goals
- The shortest and the simplest belt path possible with AWD compatibility
- The shortest moment arms possible for increased rigidity even when reusing hardware and motion parts
- Double shear steppers and live shaft idlers for higher belt tensions and better reliability
- Good-looking design
- Cheap BOM

## Performance expectations
**2WD:** Due to the 10-15cm shorter belt path, with stiffer and lighter XY-joints the printer should perform similarly to a 50mm smaller one equipped with the same X-axis setup.

**AWD:** It doesn't come at the cost of adding 20cm belt length and idlers, so input shaper scaling can be close to +100% compared to 2WD due to the truly halved effective belt length. But only when no toolhead or frame bottlenecks are limiting its scaling.

**9mm belts:** Wider belts can offer an additional 50% input shaper scaling on top of what's described above.

## What's the catch?
- you have to build a well-balanced system: the increased effective belt stiffness with higher-end gantry configurations will amplify toolhead and frame rigidity issues
- Some toolheads are not yet compatible because of the different belt path
- Z-chain relocation or Z-umbilical is needed on V2
- Trident rear vertical extrusion brackets have to be rotated by 180 degrees or swapped to regular 2020 brackets based on the gantry configuration
